Introduction to data

In October 2023, "world champion barista" James Hoffmann and coffee company Cometeer held the "Great American Coffee Taste Test" on YouTube, during which viewers were asked to fill out a survey about 4 coffees they ordered from Cometeer for the tasting. Data blogger Robert McKeon Aloe analyzed the data the following month. This data set can be found under the 2024 folder in TidyTuesday.
